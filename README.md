3. Navigate to the cloned repository.
    ```
    cd filename
    ```

4. Create a new branch to work on with
    ```markdown
    git checkout -b my-new-branch

    >  Time to make some changes to the cloned repository on your local machine.

5. Add your work with

6. Save your work, by committing it.
    ```markdown
    git commit -m "first commit"
    ```

7. Let's try pushing it on a remote repository, in our case GitHub!

### Avoid Conflicts (Syncing the fork)

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an `upstream` for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

```
git remote add upstream <git repo>
```

Verify that the new remote was been added by
```
git remote -v
```

To pull new changes from the parent repository, just do

```
git merge upstream/master
```
